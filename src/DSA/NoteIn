==what are the reasons behind making strings immutable in Java
In short, immutability makes strings safe to share, thread-safe, and reliable when used in collections
String Pool
Optimization: Java designers knew strings would be heavily used, so they created a "String pool" to store string
literals.
Sharing: Immutable strings can be shared safely. Mutable strings can't be shared because they can change, causing
issues.
Collections
HashMaps and HashTables: Strings are often used as keys. If strings were mutable, they could change after being added
to a collection, causing problems with data retrieval. Immutable strings prevent this issue.

==differentiate between a String, StringBuffer, and a StringBuilder?
Storage area: In string, the String pool serves as the storage area. For StringBuilder and StringBuffer, heap memory
is the storage area.
Mutability: A String is immutable, whereas both the StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable.
Efficiency: It is quite slow to work with a String. However, StringBuilder is the fastest in performing operations.
The speed of a StringBuffer is more than a String and less than a StringBuilder.
